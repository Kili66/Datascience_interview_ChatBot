## Overview
This project is a Datascience Interview Chatbot built using NLP, deep learning with PyTorch, and a Tkinter-based user interface. The chatbot is designed to simulate a datascience interview and provide relevant responses.

## Features
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts, including NLTK, Tokenization, Stemming, and Bag of Words.
- PyTorch-based deep learning model for chatbot training.
- Tkinter-based user interface for a seamless chatbot interaction.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NLTK library
- PyTorch

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/datascience-interview-chatbot.git
   cd datascience-interview-chatbot
## Usage
1. NLP Preprocessing
* Understanding NLP preprocessing concepts: NLTK, Tokenization, Stemming, Bag of Words.
* Download NLTK and write functions for each preprocessing step.
2. Create Training Data
* Create training data for the chatbot.
* Apply tokenization and stemming to the training data.
3. PyTorch Model
* Create a PyTorch model for the chatbot.
* Implement model training.
4. Save the Model
* Save the trained PyTorch model for later use.
5. Implement Tkinter App
* Develop a Tkinter-based user interface for the chatbot.
I* ntegrate NLP preprocessing and the PyTorch model into the Tkinter app.
